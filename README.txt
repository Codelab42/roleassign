BACKGROUND
----------

It is possible for site administrators to delegate the administration
through the administer users permission. But the administer users
permission doesn't include the right to assign roles to the user. That
is necessary if the delegatee should be able to administrate the user
accounts without intervention from a site administrator.

To delegate the assignment of roles, site administrators have had
until now no other choice than also grant the administer access
control permission. But that is not advisable. The administer access
control permission is very far-reaching, giving rights to access all
roles, and worse, to grant any rights to any role. That can be abused
by the delegatee, who can assign himself all rights and thereby take
control over the site.

This module solves this dilemma by introducing the assign roles
permission. While editing a user's account information, a user with
this permission will be able to select roles for the user from a set
of available roles. Roles available are configured by the site
administrator.


CONFIGURATION
-------------

1. Go to administer >> access control. Under the permissions tab,
   grant assign roles permission to those roles that should be able to
   assign roles to other users. Notice that besides the assign roles
   permission, these roles also must have the administer users
   permission.


2. Go to administer >> access control. Under the RoleAssign tab,
   select those roles that should be available for assignment by users
   with assign roles permission.


3. Go to administer >> users. For each user that should be able to
   assign roles, click on the corresponding edit link, and assign the
   user a role with both the assign roles and the administer users
   permissions.


USAGE
-----

1. Log in as a user with both the assign roles and the administer
   users permissions.


2. To change the roles of a user, go to administer >> users and click
   on the user's edit link. Review the assignable roles and change the
   as necessary.
